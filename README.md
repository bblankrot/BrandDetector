# BrandDetector
In this project, I developed a model for detecting brand names in transcribed ads using natural language processing. Digital audio advertising is a growing industry that recently surpasses $4.5B, and detecting information about any given advertisement, such as the featured brand and industry, can lead to valuable insights. This is a consulting project for [Veritonic](https://www.veritonic.com), and the original training data is proprietary and therefore not available here.
